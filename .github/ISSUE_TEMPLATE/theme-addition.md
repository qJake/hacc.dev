Please read these instructions carefully! 

1. EXPORT your theme file from your HACC admin area. You should get a "*.theme.json" file. Attach that file to this issue.
2. Take a screenshot of your theme. Don't include extra whitespace around the edges. Don't include personal information like your photo if you don't want the world to see it. Name it "screenshot.png". Attach it to this issue.
3. In the section below where it asks if you have attached the appropriate files, write "Yes".
